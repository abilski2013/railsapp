# Ruby on Rails App - Interactions

This is an app used to track interactions you have with friends, family, and colleagues, and gleam insights about your social life. Focus is on stunning data visualization and analysis. I want this to be extremely intuitive and easy for all users to navigate, use, and consume the information over time.
